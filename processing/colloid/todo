1. traj_plot gdfdata [t0:[dt:]t1]
---------------------------------
I need to show trajectories since sometimes, tracking is not good enough,
hence an image-assistant analysis is necessary.
Just like most people showed 10s trajectories purely from xyt data, I need 
to add more information, to show the trendancy of each particle.
I can use color (rainbow) to show the tagged time, red for old one, and blue
for lastest one. The time window is given by t0 and t1, and resolution is given
by dt.

2. traj_plot gdfdata timewindow [t0:[dt:]t1]
--------------------------------------------
same as above, and the only different thing is that this function gives a 
dynamic figure that time is flowing, and oldest particles disappear and new
ones come out. The color is shifted also.
Here t0 and t1 is the beginning and end of the frame for the dynamic showing,
and should not be confused with the above one.
Maybe a modification should be done to combine the two or unify the two ones.

Remark: I want to use those functions to analysis the flux (particle flow) in
Peng Yi's solid-solid transition data. The data can hardly track well, and
flux cannot be calculated accurately. Hence an image-assistant analysis is
quite necessary.
I have already written a progam "config_plot" for showwing particle positions
in each frame, it should be equal to "traj_plot gdfdata timewindow=1".

I have implimented such a program, with unified functions. However, the plot
part is extramely slow. I have tested it by typical data, and found that
the plot part can not work properly, as expected.
The only useful part is the static part, however, since the data is removed
after excuting the program, hence a detail zoom in is unavaible at last.
Since generally speaking, this program is completely a failure for the supported functions.

1. sk
The program is needed to be fixed.
(Aug 6, 2012)
I add the key part of points2image program into sk, to make the plot more smooth. I found that without this part, the 2D sk is OK, however, the angular averaged sk is quite bad (not due to the statistics for sure).
The results is not better at all even I account for such above part.
So what's the problem???

1. track
2. feature
3. 3D msd
4. refine normal mode part
5. add doc

I need to first finish analysising Zhongyu's ellipsoids' data (maybe with Li Bo)
Due to bad tracking (usually bad), I need to write a program can handle missing particles.
May be I can interoplate the position for those missing particles. I need the program to be adaptive.
Hence first I need a program to found out particles with long trajectories. If short, the crop those particles.
Then interoplate the missing particles to make the data better (artificial effects may come into)
And the last, traditional normal modes analysis.

In future, when plot configurations with other quantities, the boundary is chosen not as [xmin-5:xmax+5]x [ymin-5:ymax+5]. It should be [xmin-aLx:xmax+aLx]x [ymin-aLy:ymax+aLy], where a=5%(more or less) and Lx=xmax-xmin, Ly=ymax-ymin. In this way, the size will be scaled to a better one. Try to use relative ratio, not absolute value in future. (Both for colloid and simulations) [affected program: plot_config, config_plot, plot_...


6:30pm pt_info has a bug when dim is given
Bug fixed.

FIFO has a limit size PIPE_BUF (4KB on Linux), a small 2D plot in pt_info 
has 1.6 KB, hence FIFO cannot serve as the communication with Gnuplot.

I revised the DOS of ellipsoidal normal modes, 'e_DOS'. I add a few codes to
remove some outliers to make the distribution better.

'traj_length':
remove "set autoscale", use xmin, xmax, ... to make the plot scale well, and
add "set tmargin at screen 0.95" to make the size of the plot bigger

spline 2D data, interpolate, to get smooth plot of 2D data
Draw an eps colorbar is too technical, so a better way is to spline 2D data

Draw 2D eigenvector magnitudes of ellipses (cannot use dots, so spline 2D)
Is this useful? Softspot?

'IR_SSD'
It seems that SSD is very sensitive, and even I used a crystal data, with
very small drift, and use 'showposition' can see good crystals, but 'IR_SSD'
still said there are multiple equilibrium positions.
So 'IR' should be modified to be more reliable.
The data mentioned here is '/home/feng/normalmode/3Dslice/trkparticle_4603.gdf'

It seems that bezier smooth in Gnuplot smooth the data quite good. Maybe
I can implement it.
I also tested that the IR_SSD result is quantitively consistent with the 
raw data smoothed by 'bezier' smoothing.
By plot the 'bezier' use points, it can be seen that the number of points 
is reduced.

Add a gdf viewer to debug the gdf dataset.

An tracked data, cannot cropped by
step 1. space_cut
step 2. trajectory_filter
The resulted data has wrong particle index. Fix the bug. Is this a bug???
A new algorithm for space_cut
select_indictor = [1 for all ptcl]
if in any frame, a ptcl is not in the selected region, then set the indictor
to 0, i.e. not select it.
Then the remained ptcls are what we selected, and also they don't leave the
selected spatial region.
