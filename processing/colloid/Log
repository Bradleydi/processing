Revise src/normalmode/uur, to calculate the total uur, and also rescaled it by
C0.

It seems that if we put functions protype in same header file, and functions 
in different folders, those files cannot have same name, even functions in 
them have different names, or a multiple definition error will occor.

'e_normalmode' for normal modes of ellipsoids has been implimented. However,
several issues are still waiting for a solution.
In this version of implementation, I accept the missing data. Even the missing
is highly correlated both in space and time, I still treat them as random.
Hence I need a more accuarate method to calculate covariance matrix for missing
data set. The second issue is that, how to plot the mode in a more beatiful
way. The last issue is how to explain the data, and what's the expectation?
The angle part of normal mode may be antiphase, hence I need some method
to deal with that. Also I need to unify the color bar.

'showposition': 
add "set tmargin at screen 0.95" to make the size of the plot bigger.

'traj_length':
remove "set autoscale", use xmin, xmax, ... to make the plot scale well, and
add "set tmargin at screen 0.95" to make the size of the plot bigger.
Add t1 t2 to avoid the initial frame not starting from 0.
Add doc to traj_length
Add pointsize to control pointsize avoid too many particles

'e_plot_mode2'
plot translational part of normal mode as vectors, and orientational part
as colored ellipse, so that one can see the nematic domain with modes.
The techneque is a old one, use parametic plot to plot ellipses.
It seems that the resulted eps file is very large (32M >> 500k), and the quantity is also low.
I'm not sure whether the new style 'with ellipse' in Gnuplot 4.6 can solve this
problem, but anyway, it seems that to generate high quantity plot, one
still need to plot directly into an EPS file.
My own 'e_plot_config' to plot 5000 ellipses only has a size 300k.
Anyway, the resulted figure still is better than the colored dots

# Features, changes and fixes in gnuplot version 4.4
# ==================================================
# * NEW plot style "with circles"
# * NEW object types circle, ellipse, and polygon

So it seems that we can use Gnuplot (>=4.4) to illustrate simulation data, for
circles, and Gnuplot (>=4.6) to illustrate simulations with ellipse.

# * NEW operators '=' and ',' in expression syntax
# * NEW command 'evaluate' executes commands from a string variable
My recent implemented 'e_plot_mode2' cannot work with Gnuplot (<4.4).
Since it uses '=' and ',', and 'eval'

# * NEW variables GPVAL_VIEW_{MAP|ROT_X|ROT_Z|SCALE|ZSCALE}, GPVAL_TERMINALS
It seems that in Gnuplot (>=4.4), we can use GPVAL_TERMINALS to control
terminals we have, and set different plot parameters for different terminals.

# * CHANGE syntax of 'set datafile binary' array= and record= options
This is unsafe for my coding.
Gnuplot will change itself version from version, so use Gnuplot in my code is
not safe, if one day Gnuplot makes some major changes. However, Gnuplot is
quite good, and there are lots of functions, so without it, coding will be
very difficult.
So now, I have to ways, one is install Gnuplot 4.6 to support 'with ellipse';
the other is to learn how to draw palette to assign a RGB color to a value,
and then use PS laguange to plot the modes. Arrays, ellipses have been known
how to draw, only color not. If use gray, it may be easy, rgb, difficult.

'e_plot_mode'
the syntax of the interface is changed, to plot with colored ellipses, not
dots.

'e_corr'
* NEW add 'e_corr' to calculate correlations between trans. and orien. part.
It seems that the definition is quite difficult.
If we use length as the trans. part, then orien. should also use 'length', i.e.
 ABS(angle), and this correlation accounts for the correlation of amplitudes.

To calculate the true correlation, ev... (lost swap file here due to connection
error)

'drift_llr'
* NEW add 'drift_llr' to smooth the drift by local linear regression (LLR)
This algorithm is new, and drift is gotten from two successive frames, by
comparing particles existing in both frames.
This feature is called by old 'ptid_drift' command, just to make it convenient
for users. Use -l or -L to run this feature, and use -d to specify dimension.
Dimension has been implemented to any for calculation, and 1-3 for plotting.
-s to specify the smooth/band width parameter. As a good practice, it's better
to use ptid_drift with old linear fitting as the beginning, to capture the 
feature of the drift. Because this program is faster (1/3 faster than that
with LLR). And then determine the smooth parameter. Set it to roughly 10%-20%
time window width as a good candidate.
I need two more things to do,
1. remove drift part
2. documentation of this part.
This is quite a good job today...

'e_softspot'
* NEW add  'e_softspot' to plot the soft spots for ellipses glasses or crystals.
The results seem good, but there is still something to improve.
The outliers seem always to exist in glass, so that the plot is affect a lot.
I don't know whether those outliers are from the rearrangement, or just
highly localized modes. This needs my new program 'e_chkRearrange'.
This new feature is used as a new separated command, 'e_softspot'.
Ran's data seems that the soft spots are large clusters,
while Zhongyu's data seems that the translational SPs are dispersed, without
forming clusters, while there is no orientional SP.
According to literature, rearrangement is also called irreversible 
reorganization (IR), so I can made the program named 'e_chkIR'.

'IR_SSD'
'SSD'
* NEW SSD is for steady state detection, hence can be used for irreversible 
rearrangment (IR) detection.
There are a few totally different algorithm for SSD. I tested two of them, also
the hybrided case. However, it seems that what I implemented ( used the ratio
of sum_squared of adjacent deviation and sum_squared of deviation from mean) is
a better one, however, it's over sensitive.
'IR_SSD' is included in the command 'IR'.

* NEW add some selection functions in mis. could be used for median, median
filter, outlier detection, median absolute deviation (MAD). 
(see robust statistics)
